Files in this folder contain html embeded within PHP files, also known as PHTML, and should adopt the extension .phtml, for clarity and seperation from 'pure' PHP files.
Using PHP to generate html pages makes development and maintence easier, as each part of an html page can be seperated then combined when rendered by the server before dispatching the page.

Pure PHP files should be marked .php

Pages which are not to be navigated to should be in a seperate (sub)folder from index.php
